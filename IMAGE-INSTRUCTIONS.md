# Adding image.png to README

## Quick Steps:

1. **Your application is currently running:**
   - Backend: http://localhost:5001
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000

2. **Take a screenshot:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - Make sure the interface is visible with chat functionality
   - Take a screenshot of the main application interface

3. **Save the screenshot:**
   - Save it as `image.png` in the root directory (same level as README.md)
   - The README.md already references `./image.png`

4. **What to capture in the screenshot:**
   - The main chat interface
   - Both mode buttons (General Chat / Document Q&A) 
   - Some sample conversation if possible
   - The sidebar showing available documents
   - The overall modern UI design

5. **Alternative approach:**
   - You can use any existing screenshot you have
   - Just rename it to `image.png` and place it in the root folder
   - Or update the README.md to point to your preferred image name/location

Once you add `image.png`, your README will display the screenshot automatically!
