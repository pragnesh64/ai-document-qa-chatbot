React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and the community.

Key features of React:
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for better performance
- JSX syntax for writing HTML-like code in JavaScript
- Unidirectional data flow
- Hooks for state management and side effects
- Large ecosystem and community support

React is widely used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications using React Native. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, making it easier to build complex user interfaces.
