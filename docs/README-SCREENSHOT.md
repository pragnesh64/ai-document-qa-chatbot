# Screenshot Instructions

To complete the README setup, please add a screenshot of your running application:

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Take a screenshot:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - Interact with both General Chat and Document Q&A modes
   - Take a screenshot showing the main interface

3. **Save the screenshot:**
   - Save the screenshot as `screenshot.png` in this `docs/` folder
   - The README will automatically reference `./docs/screenshot.png`

4. **Alternative locations for screenshot:**
   - You can also place it directly in the root folder as `screenshot.png`
   - Or create an `assets/` folder and place it there
   - Just update the image path in README.md accordingly

## Example Screenshot Content

Your screenshot should ideally show:
- The main chat interface
- Both mode buttons (General Chat / Document Q&A)
- Some sample conversation
- The sidebar with available documents
- The modern, responsive UI design

This will help users understand what the application looks like and its capabilities at a glance.
